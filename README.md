reading emotions over webcam

## P5 experiment
* Using https://p5js.org/
* P5 used an index.html and sketch.js structure to run processing-like code in a browser
* When working with pretrained models, these need to be downloaded first (weights), e.g. https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights (put these in a models folder)

## Deepface experiment
```console
  pip install deepface opencv-python
```
